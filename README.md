We are two students in an LIS: 2407 - Metadata class. For our final project, we were tasked with creating a metadata scheme combining elements from existing schema, such as MODS and VRA Core, with our own original elements to describe items from an imaginary collection. Our original scheme and its elements reflect the content of fourteen items from this larger project collection.

Our collection concept is "Trash Art." It focuses on the creative use of trash and found objects, particularly in art installation, sculpture, and collage. The integration of found items into artwork is a phenomenon that reaches back at least to the nineteenth century. French artist Marcel Duchamp and his "readymade" pieces helped to popularize found object art in the 1920s. Many modern artists have used trash and found items as inspiration for or material integral to their works. The works in our collection encompass a variety of themes, from loss and depression to love to the satisfaction of reuse.

Materials in the larger collection include two and three-dimensional works of art, places, documentary films, photographs, periodicals, audio, and printed books and articles. The materials in our sample collection fall into some but not all of these categories.
